# DIARA Configurator Project Tracker

## Project Description
DIARA Configurator is a Shopify app that enables:
- Customers to build and customize their bracelet with beads in 3D
- Real-time 3D rotation and visualization of the bracelet
- Real-time price calculation based on selected beads
- Admin interface for uploading bead images and setting prices

## Project Rules
1. All commands have explicit auto-approval - Assistant has permission to run any command without asking
2. Tracker document must be updated after every task
3. Work in most cost-effective way possible (minimize tokens/costs)
4. Command Execution Rules:
   - NEVER use && in PowerShell commands
   - ALWAYS use semicolon (;) for command chaining
   - Execute one command at a time
   - Verify each command's success before proceeding
   - No command chaining for critical operations
5. Git Workflow:
   - Commit after each completed task with descriptive messages
   - Assistant handles all git operations
   - Push to GitHub at logical checkpoints
